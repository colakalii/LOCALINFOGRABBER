Here you can grab your needings from a computer and send it to your SMB server if you wish. There will be 2 seperate output as one will placed on your desktop while the other one getting copied to your SMB. 
You need to configure SMB needings if you want to use it. If not, you can just pass and ignore the error at the end. It'll create .txt on your desktop anyway. Enjoy.
